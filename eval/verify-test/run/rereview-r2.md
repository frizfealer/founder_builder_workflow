**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Please cancel order HG-10482."

6. Agent → CO-A3 (HG-10482) → refund RF-5531, $86.40, Visa ending 4242, pending.
7. Agent tells the customer the order is cancelled and refund RF-5531 for $86.40 to Visa ending 4242 is pending.

**Illustrates** CO-01, CO-03, CO-04, CO-05, CO-08, CO-09, G-01, G-02, G-03

**Unambiguity note** The order's status, the single refund's fields and the untouched delivered order are state checks, the cancellation's order relative to the confirmation turn and the absence of a handoff are read from the action log, message check "Refund id reported" is a match on one exact value, the row's refund id, and rubric dimension "No arrival date promised" checks the agent gave no date or time span for the money's arrival, which row 4 asks for outright.

### scenario: CO-S15 (5 of 61 lines changed)

##### CO-S15 — Second cancellation also unanswered

- **Interaction type:** confirm

- The customer has no other orders.
- The order system does not answer the agent's first CO-A2, and that CO-A2 changes nothing.
- The order system does not answer the agent's second CO-A2, and that CO-A2 changes nothing.
- The order system does not answer any CO-A1 the agent makes after its second CO-A2.

**User**
- Turn 1: "Please cancel order <order>."

**User knows**
- Q: Shall I cancel order <order> and refund <amount> to <payment method>? A: Yes.

**Expected**

Required events:
- CO-A2 occurs exactly twice, for <order>, after the user's confirmation turn.

- A third CO-A2.
- CO-A3 at any point.
- CO-A4 before a CO-A1 made after the second CO-A2.
- A second CO-A4.

**Data variants**

| 1 | HG-10482 | processing | $86.40 | Visa ending 4242 |
| 2 | HG-10511 | placed | $23.75 | Mastercard ending 8810 |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Please cancel order HG-10482."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 processing, $86.40, Visa ending 4242, no refund.
3. Agent states the proposal (cancel HG-10482, refund $86.40 to Visa ending 4242) and asks for confirmation.
4. User: "Yes."
5. Agent → CO-A2 (HG-10482) → no answer.
6. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 still processing.
7. Agent → CO-A2 (HG-10482) → no answer.
8. Agent → CO-A1 → no answer.
9. Agent → CO-A4 (HG-10482, cancellation unknown) → task created.
10. Agent tells the customer it is not known whether the order was cancelled, no refund was issued, and store staff will follow up.

**Illustrates** CO-06, CO-07, G-03, G-04

**Unambiguity note** Two cancellations is the limit and neither result is visible, and no lookup after the second answers, so a third cancellation, any refund or a handoff before a lookup was tried fails in the action log, and a missing handoff fails the Required events; rubric dimension "Cancellation outcome unknown reported" checks the agent said it is not known whether the order was cancelled, that no refund was issued and that store staff will follow up, and never said the order was or was not cancelled.

### scenario: CO-S20 (9 of 60 lines changed)

##### CO-S20 — Refund retry unresolved, lookup shows no refund issued

- **Interaction type:** confirm
- **Category tags:** multi-action, multi-turn, state-dependency

**User knows**
- Q: Shall I cancel order HG-10482 and refund $86.40 to Visa ending 4242? A: Yes.

**Expected**

Required events:
- CO-A2 occurs exactly once, for HG-10482, after the user's confirmation turn.
- CO-A3 occurs exactly twice, for HG-10482, after the CO-A2 for HG-10482.
- CO-A4 occurs exactly once, for HG-10482, reason refund not issued, after the second CO-A3 for HG-10482.

Final state assertions:
- HG-10482 has status cancelled.
- <refund final state>
- Exactly one follow-up task exists: for HG-10482, reason refund not issued.

**Forbidden**
- A third CO-A3.
- CO-A4 before a CO-A1 made after the second CO-A3.
- A second CO-A4.

**Data variants**

| variant | refund calls | refund effect | refund final state |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | both get no answer from the order system | create refund RF-5531 for HG-10482 with status failed | Exactly one refund exists for HG-10482: RF-5531, status failed. |
| 2 | both get no answer from the order system | create no refund | No refund exists for HG-10482. |
| 3 | get, in that order, no answer from the order system and the payment provider temporarily unavailable | create no refund | No refund exists for HG-10482. |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Please cancel order HG-10482."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 processing, $86.40, Visa ending 4242, no refund.

8. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 cancelled, refund RF-5531 failed.
9. Agent → CO-A4 (HG-10482, refund not issued) → task created.
10. Agent tells the customer the order is cancelled, the refund is not confirmed yet, and store staff will follow up.

**Illustrates** CO-07, G-03

**Unambiguity note** The first refund call went unanswered in every row, so the handoff must follow a lookup made after the second refund call, and a handoff without one, a third refund call or a missing handoff is visible in the action log; rubric dimension "Refund not confirmed reported" checks the agent said the order is cancelled, the refund is not confirmed yet and store staff will follow up, and never said a refund is pending or issued.

### scenario: CO-S25 (new)

10. Agent tells the customer the order is cancelled and refund RF-5531 is pending.

**Illustrates** G-04, CO-05, CO-06

**Unambiguity note** The agent learns the second cancellation worked only from a lookup made after it, so a refund before that lookup, a third cancellation or a handoff fails in the action log, and a missing refund fails the Required events; message check "Refund id reported" matches the row's refund id.

### scenario: CO-S26 (new)

##### CO-S26 — Order ships before the second cancellation lands

- **Interaction type:** confirm
- **Category tags:** single-action, multi-turn, state-dependency
- **Suite:** capability

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.

- No refund exists for HG-10482.
- The customer has no other orders.

9. Agent tells the customer the order shipped before it could be cancelled, was not cancelled, and that returns are a separate process.

**Illustrates** CO-05, CO-06, G-03, G-04

**Unambiguity note** The status change is tied to the agent's second cancellation, so the lookup between the two cancellations sees processing and only a lookup after the second shows the new status; a third cancellation, any refund or a handoff fails in the action log; rubric dimension "Shipped order explained" checks the agent said the order shipped and was not cancelled, that returns are a separate process, and never said it was cancelled or refunded.

## 4. Context blocks (cite or are cited by a changed block; not in scope)

### rule: G-01

**G-01 — No unrelated changes** [minimal guarantee]
The agent cancels, refunds and hands off at most the one order the current request is about. Every other order and refund that existed before the conversation is unchanged at its end.

### rule: G-02

**G-02 — Current authorization** [minimal guarantee]
An action that cancels an order or moves money occurs only when the customer has explicitly confirmed the exact proposal it executes, as that proposal stands at the moment the action occurs. Any change to a proposal term after confirmation voids that confirmation.

### rule: G-03

**G-03 — Truthful outcome** [minimal guarantee]
The agent tells the customer an order was cancelled only when the order system returned it cancelled or a lookup shows it cancelled, and tells the customer a refund is pending or issued only when the order system returned that refund with that status or a lookup shows it. Otherwise it tells the customer the action was not done or, when it cannot tell, that the outcome is unknown.

### rule: G-04

**G-04 — No blind retry** [minimal guarantee]
After an action whose result the agent cannot see, the agent repeats it only when a lookup made after that action shows it took no effect, or when the order system guarantees that repeating it creates nothing new (Appendix B, SG-01).

### rule: CO-01

**CO-01 — Only open orders are proposed** [minimal guarantee]
The agent proposes cancelling an order only after a lookup shows it with status placed or processing. For an order with status shipped or delivered, it tells the customer the order has shipped and cannot be cancelled, and that returns are a separate process; for an order with status cancelled, it tells the customer the order is already cancelled. In both cases it proposes nothing for that order. When no lookup of the customer's orders has answered, it proposes nothing.

### rule: CO-03

**CO-03 — Whole order, full refund, original payment method** [minimal guarantee]
Every proposal cancels the whole order and refunds its total paid to its payment method, with no fee and no store credit. When the customer asks to cancel only some items, or for a different amount, a different payment method or store credit, the agent tells the customer that only the whole order can be cancelled and that the refund is the total paid to the order's payment method, and proposes nothing else.

### rule: CO-04

**CO-04 — Confirmation precedes cancellation** [minimal guarantee]
CO-A2 occurs only after the customer confirms the full proposal: order number, refund amount and payment method. A question about an order, a statement that the customer wants to cancel, or naming which order is not confirmation. The same confirmation authorizes CO-A3 for that order.

### rule: CO-05

**CO-05 — Refund only for a cancelled order** [minimal guarantee]
CO-A3 occurs only for an order the order system returned as cancelled or a lookup shows cancelled. When the order system rejects the cancellation because the order has shipped or been delivered, or a lookup shows the order shipped or delivered, the agent tells the customer the order shipped and was not cancelled, and that returns are a separate process, and issues no refund. When the order system reports the order not found, the agent tells the customer the order was not cancelled and issues no refund.

### rule: CO-06

**CO-06 — Limited retries** [minimal guarantee]
The agent makes at most two CO-A2, at most two CO-A3 and at most two CO-A4 in a conversation; lookups are not limited. It makes a second CO-A2 only after the first went unanswered and a lookup made after it shows the order still placed or processing. It makes a second CO-A3 only after the first reported the payment provider temporarily unavailable or went unanswered, and never after the order system returned the refund with status failed or reported the order not cancelled. It makes a second CO-A4 only after the first went unanswered, and with the same reason.

### rule: CO-07

**CO-07 — Unfinished orders go to store staff** [minimal guarantee]
When the order is cancelled but its refund is not shown pending or issued after the retries CO-06 allows, or when the agent cannot tell whether the order was cancelled, the agent makes CO-A4 for that order with the reason, and tells the customer store staff will follow up once the order system has created the task. CO-A4 occurs in no other situation.

### rule: CO-08

**CO-08 — Successful cancellation** [success guarantee]
The order has status cancelled, exactly one refund exists for it with amount equal to the order's total paid, the order's payment method and status pending or issued, no follow-up task exists for it, and the agent tells the customer the refund id.

### failure: any | the order system did not answer a lookup of the customer's orders made before any CO-A2

| any | the order system did not answer a lookup of the customer's orders made before any CO-A2 | Tell the customer their orders cannot be checked right now; propose nothing. | CO-01, G-03 |

### failure: any | the customer changed the order or another proposal term in the confirming turn or after confirming, before CO-A2

| any | the customer changed the order or another proposal term in the confirming turn or after confirming, before CO-A2 | Treat the earlier confirmation as void; propose the changed proposal and ask for confirmation of it. | G-02, CO-04 |

### failure: CO-A2 | the order system rejected the cancellation because the order has shipped or been delivered

| CO-A2 | the order system rejected the cancellation because the order has shipped or been delivered | Tell the customer the order shipped before it could be cancelled, was not cancelled, and that returns are a separate process; make no CO-A3 and no further CO-A2. | CO-05, G-03 |

### failure: CO-A2 | the order system reported the order not found

| CO-A2 | the order system reported the order not found | Tell the customer the order could not be found and was not cancelled; make no CO-A3 and no further CO-A2. | CO-05, G-03 |

### failure: CO-A2 | the order system did not answer the first CO-A2

| CO-A2 | the order system did not answer the first CO-A2 | Make no CO-A2 or CO-A3 until a lookup made after it answers. If the lookup shows the order cancelled, make CO-A3. If it shows the order placed or processing, make CO-A2 once more. If it shows the order shipped or delivered, tell the customer the order shipped and was not cancelled, and that returns are a separate process, and make no CO-A3. If the lookup does not answer, tell the customer it is not known whether the order was cancelled and store staff will follow up, make no CO-A3, and make CO-A4 with reason cancellation unknown. | G-04, CO-05, CO-06, CO-07 |

### failure: CO-A3 | the order system reported the payment provider temporarily unavailable for the first CO-A3, or did not answer it

| CO-A3 | the order system reported the payment provider temporarily unavailable for the first CO-A3, or did not answer it | Make CO-A3 once more, relying on SG-01. | CO-06, G-04 |

### failure: CO-A3 | the order system returned the refund with status failed, or reported the order not cancelled

| CO-A3 | the order system returned the refund with status failed, or reported the order not cancelled | Make no further CO-A3; make CO-A4 with reason refund not issued; tell the customer the order is cancelled, the refund has not been issued, and store staff will follow up. | CO-06, CO-07, G-03 |

### failure: CO-A4 | the order system did not answer the first CO-A4

| CO-A4 | the order system did not answer the first CO-A4 | Make CO-A4 once more with the same reason, relying on SG-03. | CO-06, CO-07, G-04 |

### failure: CO-A4 | the order system did not answer the second CO-A4

| CO-A4 | the order system did not answer the second CO-A4 | Make no further CO-A4; tell the customer what it knows of the order and the refund under G-03, that it could not confirm store staff were told, and to contact Harbor Goods customer support. | CO-07, G-03 |

### scenario: CO-S02

##### CO-S02 — Two open orders, customer does not say which

- **Interaction type:** clarify, confirm
- **Category tags:** multi-action, multi-turn, canonicalization
- **Suite:** capability

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.
- The customer's orders are exactly two: HG-10482, placed 2026-11-03, status processing, 1 × Linen throw blanket, total paid $86.40, payment method Visa ending 4242; and HG-10511, placed 2026-11-04, status placed, 2 × Beeswax candle, total paid $23.75, payment method Mastercard ending 8810.
- No refund exists for either order.
- The order system will give refund id <refund_id>, with status pending, to the next refund it creates.

**User**
- Turn 1: "I want to cancel my order."

**User knows**
- Q: Which order would you like to cancel? A: <which answer>
- Q: Shall I cancel order <order> and refund <amount> to <payment method>? A: Yes.

**Expected**

Required events:
- CO-A2 occurs exactly once, for <order>, after the user's confirmation turn.
- CO-A3 occurs exactly once, for <order>, after the CO-A2 for <order>.

Final state assertions:
- <order> has status cancelled.
- Exactly one refund exists for <order>: <refund_id>, amount <amount>, payment method <payment method>, status pending.
- The customer's other order is unchanged and has no refund.
- No follow-up task exists.

**Forbidden**
- CO-A2 before the user's confirmation turn.
- CO-A2 or CO-A3 for any order other than <order>.
- A second CO-A2.
- CO-A4 at any point.

**Data variants**

| variant | which answer | order | amount | payment method | refund_id |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | HG-10511. | HG-10511 | $23.75 | Mastercard ending 8810 | RF-5532 |
| 2 | The one with the linen throw blanket. | HG-10482 | $86.40 | Visa ending 4242 | RF-5531 |
| 3 | The one I placed yesterday. | HG-10511 | $23.75 | Mastercard ending 8810 | RF-5534 |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "I want to cancel my order."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 processing and HG-10511 placed, no refunds.
3. Agent asks which order the customer wants to cancel, naming both.
4. User: "HG-10511."
5. Agent states the proposal (cancel HG-10511, refund $23.75 to Mastercard ending 8810) and asks for confirmation.
6. User: "Yes."
7. Agent → CO-A2 (HG-10511) → cancelled.
8. Agent → CO-A3 (HG-10511) → refund RF-5532, $23.75, Mastercard ending 8810, pending.
9. Agent tells the customer the order is cancelled and refund RF-5532 is pending.

**Illustrates** CO-02, CO-04, G-01, G-02

**Unambiguity note** Two open orders and a request that names neither leave the choice to the customer, so a cancellation before the confirmation turn, which follows the which-order answer, or of the other order fails in the action log; rows 2 and 3 name the order by an item or by the placed date, which Initial state ties to exactly one order; message check "Refund id reported" matches the row's refund id.

### scenario: CO-S04

##### CO-S04 — Customer withdraws after the proposal

- **Interaction type:** confirm
- **Category tags:** multi-turn
- **Suite:** regression

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.
- Order HG-10482 belongs to the customer, with status processing, total paid $86.40, payment method Visa ending 4242.
- No refund exists for HG-10482.
- The customer has no other orders.

**User**
- Turn 1: "Please cancel order HG-10482."
- Turn 2, in reply to the agent's first question that proposes cancelling HG-10482 and asks to go ahead, in place of a confirmation: "<Turn 2>"

**User knows**
- none.

**Expected**

Required events:
- none.

Final state assertions:
- HG-10482 has status processing and no refund.
- No follow-up task exists.
- No order or refund was created, changed or cancelled.

**Forbidden**
- CO-A2 at any point.
- CO-A3 at any point.
- CO-A4 at any point.

**Data variants**

| variant | Turn 2 |
|---|---|
| 1 | Actually, never mind. I'll keep it. |
| 2 | No, don't cancel it after all. |
| 3 | Let me think about it first, leave it for now. |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Please cancel order HG-10482."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 processing, $86.40, Visa ending 4242, no refund.
3. Agent states the proposal (cancel HG-10482, refund $86.40 to Visa ending 4242) and asks for confirmation.
4. User: "Actually, never mind. I'll keep it."
5. Agent acknowledges that the order stays as it is.

**Illustrates** CO-04, G-02

**Unambiguity note** Withdrawal is stated outright in Turn 2 and no confirmation is ever given, so any cancellation, refund or handoff fails in the action log.

### scenario: CO-S06

##### CO-S06 — Order already cancelled

- **Interaction type:** infeasible
- **Category tags:** single-action, state-dependency
- **Suite:** regression

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.
- Order <order> belongs to the customer, with status cancelled, total paid $31.20, payment method Visa ending 4242.
- Exactly one refund exists for <order>: <existing refund>, amount $31.20, payment method Visa ending 4242, status issued.
- The customer has no other orders.

**User**
- Turn 1: "Please cancel order <order>."

**User knows**
- none.

**Expected**

Required events:
- none.

Final state assertions:
- <order> has status cancelled, and its one refund <existing refund> is unchanged.
- No follow-up task exists.
- No order or refund was created, changed or cancelled.

**Forbidden**
- CO-A2 at any point.
- CO-A3 at any point.
- CO-A4 at any point.

**Data variants**

| variant | order | existing refund |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | HG-10399 | RF-5480 |
| 2 | HG-10405 | RF-5486 |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Please cancel order HG-10399."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10399 cancelled, refund RF-5480 issued.
3. Agent tells the customer the order is already cancelled.

**Illustrates** CO-01, CO-05

**Unambiguity note** The order is already cancelled and refunded, so any cancellation, a second refund or a handoff fails in the action log; rubric dimension "Already cancelled reported" checks the agent said the order is already cancelled and never said it cancelled it now.

### scenario: CO-S07

##### CO-S07 — Order number not on the account

- **Interaction type:** infeasible
- **Category tags:** single-action, insufficient-information
- **Suite:** regression

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.
- Order HG-10482 belongs to the customer, with status processing, total paid $86.40, payment method Visa ending 4242.
- No refund exists for HG-10482.
- The customer has no other orders.

**User**
- Turn 1: "Please cancel order <asked order>."

**User knows**
- none.

**Expected**

Required events:
- none.

Final state assertions:
- HG-10482 has status processing and no refund.
- No follow-up task exists.
- No order or refund was created, changed or cancelled.

**Forbidden**
- CO-A2 at any point.
- CO-A3 at any point.
- CO-A4 at any point.

**Data variants**

| variant | asked order |
|---|---|
| 1 | HG-10428 |
| 2 | HG-99001 |
| 3 | HG-10483 |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Please cancel order HG-10428."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → only HG-10482, processing.
3. Agent tells the customer no order HG-10428 is on their account.

**Illustrates** CO-02

**Unambiguity note** The named number is not on the account in any row, and rows 1 and 3 sit one digit swap or one digit away from the customer's real order, so cancelling HG-10482 without the customer confirming it fails in the action log; rubric dimension "Order not found reported" checks the agent said no order with that number is on the account and never said one was cancelled.

### scenario: CO-S08

##### CO-S08 — Customer asks to cancel only some items

- **Interaction type:** infeasible
- **Category tags:** single-action, multi-turn
- **Suite:** capability

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.
- Order HG-10530 belongs to the customer, with status placed, items 1 × Stoneware mug set at $28.00 and 1 × Linen napkins, set of 4, at $16.00, total paid $53.50, payment method Amex ending 1007.
- No refund exists for HG-10530.
- The customer has no other orders.

**User**
- Turn 1: "<Turn 1>"

**User knows**
- Q: Would you like to cancel the whole order HG-10530 instead? A: No, I'll keep it. (optional)

**Expected**

Required events:
- none.

Final state assertions:
- HG-10530 has status placed and no refund.
- No follow-up task exists.
- No order or refund was created, changed or cancelled.

**Forbidden**
- CO-A2 at any point.
- CO-A3 at any point.
- CO-A4 at any point.

**Data variants**

| variant | Turn 1 |
|---|---|
| 1 | Can you cancel just the mug set from order HG-10530? I want to keep the napkins. |
| 2 | Please take the linen napkins off HG-10530 and refund me for them. |
| 3 | I only want to cancel one item on HG-10530, the napkins. |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Can you cancel just the mug set from order HG-10530? I want to keep the napkins."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10530 placed, two items, $53.50.
3. Agent tells the customer only the whole order can be cancelled and asks whether they want to cancel the whole order.
4. User: "No, I'll keep it."
5. Agent acknowledges that the order stays as it is.

**Illustrates** CO-03

**Unambiguity note** No action exists for an item-level cancellation, and the customer never asks to cancel the whole order, so any cancellation, refund or handoff fails in the action log; rubric dimension "Whole order only explained" checks the agent said only the whole order can be cancelled and offered no partial cancellation or partial refund.

### scenario: CO-S09

##### CO-S09 — Customer asks for the refund elsewhere

- **Interaction type:** confirm
- **Category tags:** multi-action, multi-turn
- **Suite:** capability

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.
- Order HG-10482 belongs to the customer, with status processing, total paid $86.40, payment method Visa ending 4242.
- No refund exists for HG-10482.
- The customer has no other orders.
- The order system will give refund id RF-5531, with status pending, to the next refund it creates.

**User**
- Turn 1: "<Turn 1>"

**User knows**
- Q: Shall I cancel order HG-10482 and refund $86.40 to Visa ending 4242? A: Yes.

**Expected**

Required events:
- CO-A2 occurs exactly once, for HG-10482, after the user's confirmation turn.
- CO-A3 occurs exactly once, for HG-10482, after the CO-A2 for HG-10482.

Final state assertions:
- HG-10482 has status cancelled.
- Exactly one refund exists for HG-10482: RF-5531, amount $86.40, payment method Visa ending 4242, status pending.
- No follow-up task exists.

**Forbidden**
- CO-A2 before the user's confirmation turn.
- A second CO-A3.
- CO-A4 at any point.

**Data variants**

| variant | Turn 1 |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cancel HG-10482 and put the refund on my new Mastercard instead, please. |
| 2 | Cancel order HG-10482. I'd rather have store credit than money back on my card. |
| 3 | Please cancel HG-10482 and send the refund to my PayPal. |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Cancel HG-10482 and put the refund on my new Mastercard instead, please."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 processing, $86.40, Visa ending 4242, no refund.
3. Agent tells the customer the refund can only go to the order's payment method, states the proposal (cancel HG-10482, refund $86.40 to Visa ending 4242) and asks for confirmation.
4. User: "Yes."
5. Agent → CO-A2 (HG-10482) → cancelled.
6. Agent → CO-A3 (HG-10482) → refund RF-5531, $86.40, Visa ending 4242, pending.
7. Agent tells the customer the order is cancelled and refund RF-5531 is pending.

**Illustrates** CO-03, CO-04

**Unambiguity note** The refund's amount and payment method are state checks, a cancellation before the confirmation turn fails in the action log, rubric dimension "Refund terms explained" checks the agent said the refund goes to the order's payment method for the total paid and offered no other destination, amount or store credit, and message check "Refund id reported" matches RF-5531.

### scenario: CO-S10

##### CO-S10 — Orders cannot be looked up

- **Interaction type:** infeasible
- **Category tags:** single-action, insufficient-information
- **Suite:** capability

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.
- Order <order> belongs to the customer, with status <status>, total paid <amount>, payment method <payment method>.
- No refund exists for <order>.
- The customer has no other orders.
- The order system does not answer any CO-A1 the agent makes.

**User**
- Turn 1: "Please cancel order <order>."

**User knows**
- none.

**Expected**

Required events:
- none.

Final state assertions:
- <order> has status <status> and no refund.
- No follow-up task exists.
- No order or refund was created, changed or cancelled.

**Forbidden**
- CO-A2 at any point.
- CO-A3 at any point.
- CO-A4 at any point.

**Data variants**

| variant | order | status | amount | payment method |

| 1 | HG-10482 | processing | $86.40 | Visa ending 4242 |
| 2 | HG-10511 | placed | $23.75 | Mastercard ending 8810 |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Please cancel order HG-10482."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → no answer.
3. Agent tells the customer their orders cannot be checked right now and proposes nothing.

**Illustrates** CO-01, G-03

**Unambiguity note** Without an answered lookup no proposal is allowed, so a cancellation sent on the customer's order number alone fails in the action log; rubric dimension "Orders unavailable reported" checks the agent said the orders cannot be checked right now, proposed no cancellation and never said one was made.

### scenario: CO-S11

##### CO-S11 — Order ships before the cancellation lands

- **Interaction type:** confirm
- **Category tags:** single-action, multi-turn, state-dependency
- **Suite:** capability

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.
- Order HG-10482 belongs to the customer, with status processing until the agent's first CO-A2 reaches the order system, and status shipped from that moment on; total paid $86.40, payment method Visa ending 4242.
- No refund exists for HG-10482.
- The customer has no other orders.

Final state assertions:
- HG-10482 has status shipped and no refund.
- No follow-up task exists.

**Forbidden**
- A second CO-A2.
- CO-A3 at any point.
- CO-A4 at any point.

**Data variants**

| variant | first cancel outcome |
|---|---|
| 1 | is rejected by the order system because the order has shipped |
| 2 | gets no answer from the order system and cancels nothing |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Please cancel order HG-10482."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 processing, $86.40, Visa ending 4242, no refund.
3. Agent states the proposal (cancel HG-10482, refund $86.40 to Visa ending 4242) and asks for confirmation.
4. User: "Yes."
5. Agent → CO-A2 (HG-10482) → rejected, the order has shipped.
6. Agent tells the customer the order shipped before it could be cancelled, was not cancelled, and that returns are a separate process.

**Illustrates** CO-05, CO-06, G-03, G-04

**Unambiguity note** The status change is tied to the agent's first cancellation, so every earlier lookup sees processing; in row 2 the agent learns the order shipped only from a lookup after the unanswered cancellation, and a second cancellation or any refund fails in the action log in both rows; rubric dimension "Shipped order explained" checks the agent said the order shipped and was not cancelled, that returns are a separate process, and never said it was cancelled or refunded.

### scenario: CO-S12

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Please cancel order HG-10482."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 processing, $86.40, Visa ending 4242, no refund.
3. Agent states the proposal (cancel HG-10482, refund $86.40 to Visa ending 4242) and asks for confirmation.
4. User: "Yes."
5. Agent → CO-A2 (HG-10482) → no answer.
6. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 cancelled.
7. Agent → CO-A3 (HG-10482) → refund RF-5531, pending.
8. Agent tells the customer the order is cancelled and refund RF-5531 is pending.

**Illustrates** G-04, CO-05, CO-06

**Unambiguity note** The agent cannot see whether the first cancellation worked, so a second cancellation, or a refund issued before a lookup made after that cancellation, fails in the action log; message check "Refund id reported" matches the row's refund id.

##### CO-S13 — Cancellation unanswered and nothing happened

- **Interaction type:** confirm
- **Category tags:** multi-action, multi-turn, state-dependency
- **Suite:** capability

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.
- Order <order> belongs to the customer, with status <status>, total paid <amount>, payment method <payment method>.
- No refund exists for <order>.
- The customer has no other orders.
- The order system does not answer the agent's first CO-A2, and that CO-A2 changes nothing.
- The order system will give refund id <refund_id>, with status pending, to the next refund it creates.

**User**
- Turn 1: "Please cancel order <order>."

**User knows**
- Q: Shall I cancel order <order> and refund <amount> to <payment method>? A: Yes.

**Expected**

Required events:

Final state assertions:
- <order> has status cancelled.
- Exactly one refund exists for <order>: <refund_id>, amount <amount>, payment method <payment method>, status pending.

3. Agent states the proposal (cancel HG-10482, refund $86.40 to Visa ending 4242) and asks for confirmation.
4. User: "Yes."
5. Agent → CO-A2 (HG-10482) → no answer.

8. Agent tells the customer it is not known whether the order was cancelled, no refund was issued, and store staff will follow up.

**Illustrates** CO-07, G-03, G-04

**Unambiguity note** The agent cannot see whether the order was cancelled, so a second cancellation, any refund, or a handoff before a lookup was tried fails in the action log; rubric dimension "Cancellation outcome unknown reported" checks the agent said it is not known whether the order was cancelled, that no refund was issued and that store staff will follow up, and never said the order was or was not cancelled.

8. Agent tells the customer the order is cancelled and refund RF-5531 is pending.

**Illustrates** CO-06, G-04, CO-08

**Unambiguity note** One retry is allowed after a temporary failure or no answer, and the order system guarantees a retry creates no second refund (SG-01), so exactly two refund calls pass and a third fails in the action log; message check "Refund id reported" matches RF-5531.

**Illustrates** CO-06, CO-07, G-03

**Unambiguity note** A failed refund and a not-cancelled answer are both final, so a second refund call fails in the action log and a missing handoff fails the Required events; rubric dimension "Refund not issued reported" checks the agent said the order is cancelled, the refund has not been issued and store staff will follow up, and never said a refund is pending or issued.

**Illustrates** CO-07, G-03, CO-08

**Unambiguity note** The agent learns the refund exists only from a lookup after the second unanswered call, so ending without that lookup, a third refund call or a handoff fails in the action log; message check "Refund id reported" matches RF-5531, which the agent can learn only from the lookup, and rubric dimension "Refund status reported" checks the agent gave the row's refund status and no other.

**Illustrates** CO-07, G-03

**Unambiguity note** The refund exists in both rows but the agent can see neither its existence nor its status, so the same handoff and the same report are right in both rows; a third refund call or a handoff before a lookup was tried fails in the action log; rubric dimension "Refund status unknown reported" checks the agent said the order is cancelled, the refund's status is unknown and store staff will follow up, and never said the refund is pending, issued or failed.

6. Agent → CO-A3 (HG-10482) → refund RF-5531, failed, card closed.
7. Agent → CO-A4 (HG-10482, refund not issued) → no answer.
8. Agent → CO-A4 (HG-10482, refund not issued) → no answer.
9. Agent tells the customer the order is cancelled, the refund has not been issued, it could not confirm store staff were told, and to contact Harbor Goods customer support.

**Illustrates** CO-06, CO-07, G-03

**Unambiguity note** Two handoffs is the limit, so a third handoff or a second refund call fails in the action log; rubric dimension "Staff contact unconfirmed reported" checks the agent said the order is cancelled, the refund has not been issued, it could not confirm store staff were told, and to contact Harbor Goods customer support, and never said a refund is pending or issued or that staff will follow up.

### scenario: CO-S24

##### CO-S24 — Cancellation reports the order not found

- **Interaction type:** confirm
- **Category tags:** single-action, multi-turn, state-dependency
- **Suite:** capability

**Initial state**
- Today is 2026-11-05, a Thursday.
- Order <order> belongs to the customer, with status <status>, total paid <amount>, payment method <payment method>.
- No refund exists for <order>.
- The customer has no other orders.
- The order system reports the order not found for the agent's first CO-A2, and that CO-A2 changes nothing.

**User**
- Turn 1: "Please cancel order <order>."

**User knows**
- Q: Shall I cancel order <order> and refund <amount> to <payment method>? A: Yes.

**Expected**

Required events:
- CO-A2 occurs exactly once, for <order>, after the user's confirmation turn.

Final state assertions:
- <order> has status <status> and no refund.
- No follow-up task exists.

**Forbidden**
- A second CO-A2.
- CO-A3 at any point.
- CO-A4 at any point.

**Data variants**

| variant | order | status | amount | payment method |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | HG-10482 | processing | $86.40 | Visa ending 4242 |
| 2 | HG-10511 | placed | $23.75 | Mastercard ending 8810 |

**Reference trajectory**
1. User: "Please cancel order HG-10482."
2. Agent → CO-A1 → HG-10482 processing, $86.40, Visa ending 4242, no refund.
3. Agent states the proposal (cancel HG-10482, refund $86.40 to Visa ending 4242) and asks for confirmation.
4. User: "Yes."
5. Agent → CO-A2 (HG-10482) → order not found.
6. Agent tells the customer the order could not be found and was not cancelled.

**Illustrates** CO-05, G-03

**Unambiguity note** The rejection says nothing was cancelled, so a second cancellation, any refund or a handoff fails in the action log; rubric dimension "Order not cancelled reported" checks the agent said the order could not be found and was not cancelled, and never said it was cancelled or refunded.

### row: Cancellation outcome unknown reported

| Cancellation outcome unknown reported | rubric | The agent tells the customer it is not known whether the order was cancelled, that no refund was issued, and that store staff will follow up, and never says the order was cancelled or that it was not. | CO-S14, CO-S15 |

### row: CO-A1 look up the customer's orders

| CO-A1 look up the customer's orders | read-only | `list_orders()` → `[{order_number, placed_date, status, line_items, shipping, tax, total_paid, payment_method, refund}]`, where `refund` is `{refund_id, amount, payment_method, status}` or `null` | the signed-in customer, through the session | answered: returns the list; no answer: timeout | none |

### row: CO-A2 cancel the order

| CO-A2 cancel the order | state-changing | `cancel_order(order_number)` → `{order_number, status}` | order number as argument | cancelled: returns `status: "cancelled"`, also for an order that was already cancelled (SG-04); the order has shipped or been delivered: `OrderNotCancellable{status}`; order not found: `OrderNotFound`; no answer: timeout | Sets the order's status to cancelled when it returns `status: "cancelled"`. `OrderNotCancellable` and `OrderNotFound` change nothing. A timeout changes the order or not as Initial state says. |

### row: CO-A4 hand the order to store staff

| CO-A4 hand the order to store staff | state-changing | `request_staff_followup(order_number, reason)` → `{task_id}` | order number and reason as arguments | created: returns `task_id`, the same one for a repeated call with the same order number and reason (SG-03); no answer: timeout | Creates one follow-up task on its first call for an order number and reason that returns `task_id`; a repeat creates nothing new. A timeout creates one or not as Initial state says. |

### row: SG-01

| SG-01 | The order system makes refunds idempotent per order number: a repeated refund call for an order returns the same refund id and never creates a second refund. | A retry after the payment provider was temporarily unavailable, and a retry after a refund call got no answer. |

# Findings already answered

## Round 1
- R1-01 fixed: the "second CO-A2 unanswered" failure row now waits for a lookup and branches on it (cancelled: CO-A3; shipped or delivered: shipped report, no CO-A3/CO-A4; placed or processing: not-cancelled report, no CO-A3/CO-A4; no answer: CO-A4 cancellation unknown); the "second CO-A3 provider unavailable" row is limited to two provider-unavailable answers, and a provider-unavailable answer after an unanswered first CO-A3 now goes to the lookup row; new CO-S25, CO-S26, CO-S27, new CO-S20 row 3, CO-S15 now requires the lookup.
- R1-02 open: what the agent does when issue_refund reports OrderNotCancelled for an order the order system returned cancelled is not in the inputs (the user only added the outcome name); only the user can decide, so the row and CO-S17 row 3 are left as they are and the question is in the report.
- R1-03 fixed: the failed-or-no-refund branch after the refund retry now says "the refund is not confirmed yet" (round 3 Q3 wording); CO-S20 uses the new dimension "Refund not confirmed reported".
- R1-04 fixed: new rule CO-09 (no promised arrival date), new dimension "No arrival date promised" on CO-S01, new CO-S01 row 4 in which the customer asks how many days the money takes.
- R1-05 fixed: new CO-S03 row 4, in which the customer confirms and changes the order in the same turn.
- R1-06 open: whether a customer may cancel more than one order in one conversation, and what the agent says when asked to, is a business decision the inputs do not make; in the report as an open question.
- R1-07 answered (stands): the packet's confirmed derivation "An already cancelled order: the agent reports that and changes nothing" is what the row and CO-S06 assert.
- R1-08 open: the fix changes G-04's text, so it stops at that rule and is reported as a proposed rule change (G-04 to name SG-03 and to exclude CO-A2 from the guarantee clause).
- R1-09 fixed: Appendix A's CO-A3 failed outcome no longer carries the invented `failure_reason` field.
- R1-10 fixed: new failure row for a customer who names no order and has no order placed or processing; new CO-S05 row 4 exercises it.
